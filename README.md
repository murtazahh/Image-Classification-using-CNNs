# Image-Classification-using-CNNs
Image Classification using CNNs: Develop a convolutional neural network to classify images into different categories using computer vision techniques.

This code defines a simple CNN with two convolutional layers and one dense layer, which is used to classify the images into different categories. The ImageDataGenerator class is used to read and preprocess the image data, which is in the form of directories containing subdirectories for each class. The flow_from_directory method is used to generate batches of image data for training and testing. The fit method is then used to train the model for a specified number of epochs.

Please note that this is a simplified example and it may not work as is on your specific dataset, you may need to adjust the parameters and architecture of the model to suit your data. Also, you may need to obtain a dataset and divide it into training and testing sets, you can use open-source datasets such as CIFAR-10, COCO, ImageNet and so on.

Also, keep in mind that training a deep learning model like this can take a lot of computational resources, so it's recommended to use a GPU or cloud-based service to train the model.
